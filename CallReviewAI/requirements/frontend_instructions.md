# Project: Call Review AI
Use this guide to build a web app that allows users to upload a call recording that analyzes the call and critiques the sales call for feedback to improve future calls.

#Feature requirements
1. Upload a call recording
2. AI analyzes the call recording
3. AI critiques the sales call for feedback to improve future calls
4. AI provides a summary of the call
5. Ai provides recommendations for improvement

Step 1:Design the upload interface:
Add a prominent "Upload" button on the main page
Create a drag-and-drop area for file selection
Display upload progress and status indicators

Step 2:Implement audio file upload:
Use HTML5 File API for client-side file handling
Implement server-side file reception and storage
Ensure proper file type validation and size limits

Step 3:Audio transcription:
Integrate a speech-to-text API (e.g., Google Cloud Speech-to-Text)
Process the uploaded audio file and generate a transcript
Store the transcript in your database

Step 4:AI analysis:
Set up an API connection to Claude.ai or another suitable LLM
Prepare prompts for call critique and feedback generation
Send the transcript to the LLM for analysis

Step 5:Display results:
Create a results page to show the transcript and AI feedback
Implement a section for critique and suggestions
Add playback controls for the original audio

Step 6: User experience enhancements:
Implement user authentication and file management
Add a dashboard for users to view their past uploads and analyses
Implement search and filtering options for call reviews

Step 7: Integration of sales expert insights:
Compile a database of sales techniques from experts like Jordan Belfort and Alex Hormozi
Incorporate these insights into the AI prompt for more targeted feedback

Step 8:Testing and refinement:
Conduct thorough testing of the upload and analysis process
Gather user feedback and iterate on the design and functionality

Step 9: Deployment:
Choose a suitable platform for hosting the web app (e.g., Heroku, Vercel, AWS)
Set up the application environment and deploy the app
Ensure proper configuration and integration with external services

Step 10: Documentation and support:
